C# Implementation of Flow-Based Programming (FBP)


General
---

In computer programming, flow-based programming (FBP) is a programming paradigm that defines applications as networks of "black box" processes, which exchange data across predefined connections by message passing, where the connections are specified externally to the processes. These black box processes can be reconnected endlessly to form different applications without having to be changed internally. FBP is thus naturally component-oriented.

FBP is a particular form of dataflow programming based on bounded buffers, information packets with defined lifetimes, named ports, and separate definition of connections.

Prerequisites
---

Install VC#2010 Express
Create a "solution" in your project (extension `.sln`), e.g. `FBP.sln`.
Rebuild this solution in VC#2010 Express

Testing your download

Run `Concord`.  When you see the screen with two panels, click on `Go`.  You should see a concordance being built using "artificial" Russian text.
